# üà∫ Foundry VTT Journal Translator

**Journal Translator** is a Foundry VTT module that adds a `Translate` option to journal entries. It sends the journal content to the OpenAI API and returns a translated version, with options to either:

- Create a new journal entry
- Prepend the translation to the original
- Replace the original content

Supports HTML preservation and uses OpenAI's batch processing for efficient handling of large journals.

## ‚ú® Features

- Adds "Translate" to the journal context menu
- Uses OpenAI's Chat Completions API (via GPT-4o)
- Supports batch translation of multiple journal pages
- Preserves Foundry-specific HTML and tags (e.g. `@Check`)
- Three translation modes: `new`, `prepend`, or `replace`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### 1. Install the Module

- Copy or clone this repo into your Foundry VTT `modules/` directory.
- Enable it in your Foundry world.

### 2. Configure Settings

Go to **Settings ‚Üí Configure Settings ‚Üí Module Settings**:

| Setting              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `OpenAI API Key`     | Your OpenAI API key. Required. |
| `Custom Prompt`      | Prompt sent to OpenAI (e.g., `"Translate to Polish."`). System prompt already contains information about preserving HTML so this is mostly to select your language. |
| `Translation Mode`   | Choose between `Create New` - creates a new Journal with the translated text, `Prepend` - prepends each page with the translated text, leaving the original at the bottom, or `Replace` - replaces the original content with translation. This can lead to data loss as the original text is removed so use with caution. |
